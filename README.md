# CastlevaniaPRG1
Source disassembly without RAM labels and generic branch and jump labels. This compiles to the original file.

I will delete the source of this game if Konami does request it. This is for education purpose. This might help do study and understand the game so you can build a patches or make hacks. You can build the original game and you are supposed to own the game to use this.
